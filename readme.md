# Shoppi

This is a project a few friends and I are working on that aims to provide an API first eCommerce solution. The idea is that currently there isn't a great eCommerce solution on the market unless you want to suffer the learning curve of Magento, the "WordPress" way of doing things in WooCommerce, or the self hosted solution Shopify. Shoppi allows you to simply connect to our endpoints and use the pieces you need, and we handle the REST ;)
